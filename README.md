# Weather Dashboard

The goal of this webpage is to retrieve weather data from another application's API, OpenWeather One Call API. 

When the application launches, the user must enter a city and click on search.

The application then displays the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index. It also displays the weather for the next 5 days.
